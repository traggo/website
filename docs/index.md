# Intro

Traggo is a tag-based time tracking tool. In traggo there are no tasks, only [tagged](terminology.md#tag) [time spans](terminology.md#timespan).

With [tags](terminology.md#tag), traggo tries to be as customizable as possible, f.ex. if you work on different projects you could add a `project`-tag.
If you like to see statistics from the different things you do, you could add a `type`-tag with values like `email`, `programming`, `meeting`. 
You can do it just as you like.

If you want to use traggo, you need to host it yourself. This way, you have the full control over your data and no third-party
may be able to read it. Have a look at our [Install Guide](install.md).
